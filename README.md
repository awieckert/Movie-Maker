# Movie-Maker

# Description
In this assignment we were tasked with combining our JavaScript knowledge with a modular file structure.

The task was to create a site that allowed individuals to set a Movie Budget and select items for their movie. One Item from each category must be selected in order for the movie to be made. The individual must also stay within their budget.
